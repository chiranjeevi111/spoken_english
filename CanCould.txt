	## ‚úÖ 6) Imaginary / Hypothetical Situations with ‚ÄúCould‚Äù

	### üîπ **When to Use:**

	Use **"could"** to talk about:
	- Something that is **not real now**, but is **possible in the future** if something changes.
	- **Imaginary dreams, goals, abilities, or conditions.**
	- Often used with **"if" clauses** (e.g., *if I had more time*, *if I tried harder*, etc.)

	Think of **"could"** as:  
	‚û°Ô∏è *"It's not true now, but it‚Äôs possible in the future or in imagination."*

	---

	### üîπ **Structure:**

	```plaintext
	Subject + could + base verb + (optional: if-clause)
	```

	  ‚Üí (Right now, I‚Äôm not a singer, but it‚Äôs possible if I start training.)
	  
	- *He could become a great leader someday.*  
	  ‚Üí (He's not a great leader now, but there's a future possibility.)
